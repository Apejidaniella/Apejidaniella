I'm an aspiring Front-End Developer passionate about crafting user-centered designs that are not just visually appealing but also functional and accessible.

With a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I graduated among the top 5 students in my department — a reflection of my strong work ethic, dedication, and problem-solving mindset. 

I’m currently focused on learning and building with HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript, and gradually transitioning into more advanced front-end technologies. I’m deeply passionate about creating intuitive, responsive, and accessible user interfaces that improve people's experience on the web.

I thrive on solving real-world problems and enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, elegant web experiences. My goal? To build meaningful solutions, help others stay productive, and continuously grow — one line of code at a time.
